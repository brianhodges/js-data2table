# Output Data Object(s)/Array(s) into Formatted Table (JS)
Just a project more for myself to refer back to when working on future Javascript/JQuery projects. Outputs an array of objects into a formatted terminal table.

# Setup
*To Run:*
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/brianhodges/js-data2table
  cd js-data2table
  node data2table.js
  ```
*Data will instantly output formatted to Terminal*
